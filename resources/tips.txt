# Tips:
1. Open a k-space EXAFS data set (the users can choose rows and columns).
2. If the users want to import multiple data column, please click "Multiple file" button in the menu. In this mode, the users can enter more than one line at a time and the number of lines should be separated by Spaces
3. Load data set and choose k-weight. If the data set has been k-weighted, just choose k-weight = 0.
4. Accept data import config and click next step. If necessary, the users can "show" the data that they imported.
5. Type in kmin/kmax/dk, Rmin/Rmax/dR, and parameters of mother wavelet in the main window.
6. Accept the parameters. If necessary, the users can "show" the wavelet that they construct. 
7. Then click "Start WT", the calculation would start and an infobox would pop.
8. Close the pop-up window and wait for a moment (3 to 10 seconds). Then another hint would show that the calculation is complete.
9. Show the WT result! It is better to save the WT result as txt file and show WT result in other apps.

# NOTICE!!!
1. Do not close the CMD window while the program is running.
2. The data extracted from ATHENA is better.
3. The program would skip lines with "#" automatically.
4. If the dk entered by the users differs from the imported data or the dK in the imported data are not coincident, the program would perform 1d linear interpolation automatically. Thus, if the users do not want to change the original information of the data, please import a data set with identical dk and without missing data.
5. The modification of dR actually affects the sampling interval of the scale parameter of mother wavelet.
6. The author is not sure whether there is any ERROR of Cauchy wavelet and Cauchy wavelet transformation.
7. If the program crashes, the users can end it by closing the CMD window.
8. The temp files generated by the program are in the "resources" folder of the program folder.
9. Inverse WT module have not been introduced.
